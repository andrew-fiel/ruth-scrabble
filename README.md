# ruth-scrabble
This project is being built with the intention of eventually running on an Arduino-run physical Scrabble board. "Ruth" is my grandma, who plays a lot of Scrabble, but does not often have opponents to play against.

## Sources That Helped
- Scrabble algorithm based on [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf).
- DAWG implementation based on [this](https://gist.github.com/smhanov/94230b422c2100ae4218).
## Heatmap
This heatmap represents the locations of tiles from the highest scoring words in 1000 games played with one rack. On average, the games took 1.614 seconds each.
